# LSS-greedy
This is a python library for generating a foci sound field, and we use two methods to do that. 1. the most simple way LSS 2. Used greedy to optimize the LSS And we compared the results with GSPAT. This library is written on Python, only for ploting the results, the computing speed will be much faster in C++ code. Please refer to the paper: "Sound Pressure Field Reconstruction for Ultrasound Phased Array by Linear Synthesis Scheme Optimization"
